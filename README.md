# IODS-final
My final work with IODS-course

You can find my web bage here: https://8475394.github.io/IODS-final/#

The idea in this work is to demonstrate the use of the Principal Component Analysis and create the principal component scores. I have used multiple packages and functions considering  the PCA, including prcomp(), PCA() from FactoMiner and principal() from psych package. 

All these functions are utilized for visualization purposes. Additionally the qgraph is used to plot the rotated PCA structure. The principal component scores were created with the psych package function.

I have added multiple web pages to track the sources of several codes. Note that some of them are inside the chunks.
